Using deep learning to detect tumors

The encoder-decoder temporal convolutional network model is derived from: https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05267
Some hyperparameters are different and a flattening layer was added towards the end of the model. It is not an exact replica of the model 
described in the paper.

Will soon test TCN model on the BRATS 2013 training dataset.
